### Hi 😊, My name is Tej.

#### 🔭 I am currently working as an Associate in [Deutsche Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank) looking after critical applications which are used by Traders to execute [Repo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement) trades.

#### 🌱 Currently trying to learn Python, Git and whatever I find interesting and  put it out there which might help others as well.
